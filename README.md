# Building-a-Random-Background-Color-Changer
This project builds a small webpage with a button that, when clicked, picks a random color. The background updates instantly, and the current color’s hex code is displayed on the screen. It’s a fun way to practice debugging, DOM selection, and JavaScript event handling.
